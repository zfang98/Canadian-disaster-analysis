##### Project: Canadian-disaster-analysis
##### 1. Introduction
##### The dataset contains 1079 disaster events happened across Canada during 1900 to 2016. Data were analyzed by Python (version 3.7), and NumPy, Pandas, DataTime, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used in this analysis.
##### 2. The following tasks were completed
##### 1) Produced a chart to compare the "TOTAL ESTIMATED COST" for each "EVENT TYPE".
##### 2) Produced a nice chart showing the number of events per year where DFAA payments (both federal and provincial) have been applied.
##### 3) Determined the duration (number of days) of the longest lasting Flood event.
##### 4) Created a new 'PROVINCE' column for each entry that contains the abbreviation for the province or territory where each event occurred.
